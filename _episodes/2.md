We dug into an odd bit of behavior in the javascript Channel + Presence
client that ships with Phoenix.

While `Presence.list/1` in Elixir returns presence metas in an
oldest-connection-first order, the javascript client instead maintains a
least-recently updated order. This inconsistency is a bug which we
explored in this episode. We added a failing mocha test, and made it
pass.

Our goal in the episode was to get to most-recently updated order,
although I didn't know at the time what the Phoenix server ordering was.

I also showed off a small Plug I made last week to give anonymous users
persistent ids.
