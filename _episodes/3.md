We tried to get a Phoenix app running on a Digital Ocean droplet. There
were a lot of issues with Elixir, Node, and npm versions, but we
eventually got the basic app running.

We got the subdomain http://live.probablyright.tv pointing to our
droplet's IP address.

We looked into [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), and used
[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to get a free 90-day SSL
certificate.

Unfortunately we ran out of time, and didn't get our Phoenix app set up
to use it and serve over HTTPS. We also only ran the app in the
foreground, and never set it up to run as a service.

But, hey, we had fun! Or something...
