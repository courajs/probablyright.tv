      <h2 id="tagline">A weekly live-coding show where we build something. TOGETHER!</h2>
      <p>Sundays at 4pm EST, join me <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/courajs">on Twitch</a> for an hour or two of coding togther. We'll have a goal for what we want to build, but we'll probably explore a few tangents together as well.</p>
      <p>I'm just getting started, so it will probably be a beautiful mess the first few times, please bear with me!</p>
      <h2>On the next episode:</h2>
      <p>We'll be building a small audience-participation app using Elixir and Phoenix, with Phoenix's channels for easy websockets.</p>
      <p>I'll explain things as I go, but check out the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">Elixir</a> and <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/overview">Phoenix</a> guides if you want to be super duper prepared.<p>
