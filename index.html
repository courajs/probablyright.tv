      <p>Fridays at 1pm EST, join me <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/courajs">on Twitch</a> for like an hour of coding togther. We'll have a goal for what we want to build, but we'll probably explore a few tangents together as well.</p>
      <p>I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>
      <h2>Today's episode (Sept 30):</h2>
      <p>We'll be contributing to Phoenix!</p>
      <p>I found a small bug in the phoenix.js client code around presences ordering. We'll figure out how to link to a development version of phoenix, how to run the phoenix.js tests, how to read &amp; generate the docs, and what goes into a good pull request.</p>
      <p>Check out the client <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/web/test/presence_test.js">tests</a> and <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/web/static/js/phoenix.js">code/docs</a>.</p>
