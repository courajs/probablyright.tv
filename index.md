Fridays at 1pm EST, join me [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/courajs) for like an hour of coding togther. We'll have a goal for what we want to build, but we'll probably explore a few tangents together as well.

I have no idea what I'm doing.

<h2>Today's episode (Sept 30):</h2>
We'll be contributing to Phoenix!

I found a small bug in the phoenix.js client code around presences ordering. We'll figure out how to link to a development version of phoenix, how to run the phoenix.js tests, how to read & generate the docs, and what goes into a good pull request.

Check out the client [tests](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/web/test/presence_test.js) and [code/docs](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/web/static/js/phoenix.js).
