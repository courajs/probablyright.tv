Fridays at 1pm EST, join me [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/courajs)
for like an hour of coding togther. We'll have a goal for what we want
to build, but we'll probably explore a few tangents together as well.

I have no idea what I'm doing.

<h2>Today's episode (Oct 14):</h2>
Intro to Ember.js!

I've been working with Ember for a while, and it's a lovely lovely tool
to work with. It handles the build and asset pipeline with ember-cli.
It's trivial to install and use add-ons. It's got fantastic, satisfying
abstractions for most things you need to do. Nice.

We'll get started on a small app I've been wanting to build for a while,
and I'll show off how to develop and test Ember.js apps.
