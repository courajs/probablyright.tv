## Today's Stream

I'm pretty interested in CardStack and where it could be going. I'm not
100% sure exactly what it's _trying_ to be, but I see it as a set of
tools for building an awesome modern CMS in the Ember ecosystem.

I thought this site about my streaming and videos would be a good
playground for it, since it's content-focused. It's currently a static
site built with jekyll on github pages, but I found that pretty
limiting, and annoying to update.

Some CardStack resources:
- [The EmberConf reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DsBHKj90EY)
- [CardStack Architecture notes](http://eaf4.com/cardstack-architecture-notes/)
- [cardstack.io](http://cardstack.io)
- [The working CardStack app demoed at EmberConf](https://github.com/ef4/emberconf-2017-demo)
- [My in-progress CardStack app](https://github.com/courajs/probably-stack)

Today I'm just generally working on it, and maybe building a simple
single-password authenticator.
