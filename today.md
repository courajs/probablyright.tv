## Today's Stream

I'm a "full-stack" developer, which means I've done all sorts of web
stuff in the browser and on the server. But in my current role at work,
I'm focused completely on front-end stuff. Our platform (back end) team
has been a little overworked lately, but there are API changes I want!
Augghhh what a world! If only there was something I could do about it...

All our server stuff is written in Scala, so I figured I'd just pick
that up real quick over the weekend, nbd.

I know basically nothing about Scala. It's functional? Runs on the JVM.
SBT is a build tool? Actually, it probably stands for Scala Build Tool
lol.

Also, I can maybe explain what a monad is? Let me know if you want me to
try.
